A tool to easily base decode/encode text
---------------------------------------------------

BaseMultiCoder is a tool used to repeatedly base encode or base decode text. This can be useful if a text has been continuously encoded multiple times with the same or different encoding formats. Additionally, this tool can be used to create an encoded text by repeatedly encoding the original text. You can choose to encode the text randomly using base16, base32, or base64 for each iteration, or use the same encoding format for every iteration.
